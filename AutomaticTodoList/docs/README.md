# Automatic To-do List

An automatically updating to-do list for common repeating tasks. Never forget to give a birthday gift, harvest a crop, or check the traveling cart again!

## Installation

1. Install the latest version of SMAPI.
1. Download this mod and unzip it into Stardew Valley/Mods.
1. Run the game using SMAPI.


## How to use

By default, the to-do list will appear in the top right corner of your screen. The default (configurable) hotkey to show/hide the list is `LeftShift + L`. Items will appear and be checked off automatically depending on different conditions.

For example, the morning of a villager's birthday, an item labelled "Give XYZ a birthday gift" will appear. Gifting the villager that day checks off the item.

Here is a list of currently supported tasks:

- Villager's birthdays
- Harvestable crops
- Unwatered crops
- Ready machines
- Tools ready for pickup
- Checking the daily quest board outside Pierre's General Store
- Checking the Special Orders Boards
- Traveling Merchant's cart

Each task type can be toggled off or on individually in the settings. All settings are fully compatible with Generic Mod Config Menu

## Compatibility

- Tested against Stardew Valley 1.6.8 on Linux.
  - Should work on any 1.6.x version on macOS/Windows.
- Tested in single player on a heavily modded save file.
  - Multiplayer should work correctly. In a multiplayer game, world actions (such as accepting a special order from a board) will update all players' to-do lists.
  - Split-screen is untested and probably will not work.
