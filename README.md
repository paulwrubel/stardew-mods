# Stardew Mods

Details on each mod is located in that mod's `docs/README.md` file.

This repository contains my SMAPI mods for Stardew Valley. See the individual mods for
documentation.

The mods can be translated into any language supported by the game, and SMAPI will automatically
use the right translations.
